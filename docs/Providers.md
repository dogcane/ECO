# ECO Providers

ECO is build with a "provider model" in mind. It's possible to define your own persistence context and configure the desired provider.
At the moment it's possible to choose between:

- [In Memory](https://github.com/dogcane/ECO/blob/master/docs/Providers-InMemory.md)
- [NHibernate](https://github.com/dogcane/ECO/blob/master/docs/Providers-NHibernate.md)
- [EFCore](https://github.com/dogcane/ECO/blob/master/docs/Providers-EF.md)

Go to the next step: [In Memory Provider](https://github.com/dogcane/ECO/blob/master/docs/Providers-InMemory.md) or go to the [Summary](https://github.com/dogcane/ECO/blob/master/docs/Summary.md) of the docs.
